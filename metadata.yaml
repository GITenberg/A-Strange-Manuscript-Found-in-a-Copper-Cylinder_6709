description: "A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder is the most popular\
  \ book by James De Mille. It was serialized posthumously and anonymously in Harper's\
  \ Weekly, and published in book form by Harper and Brothers of New York City during\
  \ 1888. It was serialized subsequently in the United Kingdom and Australia, and\
  \ published in book form in the United Kingdom and Canada. Later editions were published\
  \ from the plates of the Harper and Brothers first edition, during the late 19th\
  \ and early 20th centuries.\nThe satiric and fantastic romance is set in an imaginary\
  \ semi-tropical land in Antarctica inhabited by prehistoric monsters and a cult\
  \ of death-worshipers called the Kosekin. Begun many years before it was published,\
  \ it is reminiscent of Edgar Allan Poe's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\
  \ and anticipates the exotic locale and fantasy-adventure elements of works of the\
  \ \"Lost World genre\" such as Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, Edgar Rice Burroughs'\
  \ The Land That Time Forgot, as well as innumerable prehistoric world movies based\
  \ loosely on these and other works. The title and locale were inspired by Edgar\
  \ Allan Poe's Ms. Found in a Bottle.\nIt was unfortunate for De Mille's reputation\
  \ as a writer that this work was published after She and King Solomon's Mines. Although\
  \ H. Rider Haggard's works were well known by then, the actual composition of De\
  \ Mille's romance pre-dated the publication of the popular romances and his ideas\
  \ were not in the least derivative from Haggard's better known works.\n From Wikipedia\
